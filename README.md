## ðŸ”„ Query Execution Flow

1. **Input Query Spec (JSON)**  
   - Defines tables, filters, joins, and projection.

2. **Load Tables**  
   - CSVs are read into pandas DataFrames.

3. **Predicate Pushdown**  
   - Filters applied before joins to shrink table sizes.

4. **Plan Generation**  
   - **Naive Plan**: executes joins in given order.  
   - **Heuristic Plan**: reorders joins based on estimated filtered sizes.  
   - **AI Plan (optional)**: uses trained ML model to predict best plan.

5. **Execution**  
   - Joins are executed according to chosen plan.  
   - Results are projected to selected columns.

6. **Explain Plan (Optional)**  
   - Prints table sizes after filtering, and join orders chosen.
